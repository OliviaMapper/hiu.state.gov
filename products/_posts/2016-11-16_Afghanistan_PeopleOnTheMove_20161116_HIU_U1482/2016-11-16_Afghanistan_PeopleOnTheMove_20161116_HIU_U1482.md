At least one million vulnerable people are on the move in Afghanistan this year. On top of existing 5 million refugee returnees since 2002, this year more than 550,000 Afghans are returning migrants and refugees from Pakistan, while another 485,000 are conflict induced internally displaced persons (IDPs).
