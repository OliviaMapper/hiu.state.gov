This map identifies IDP sites in Syria, official refugee camp locations in Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq, as well as areas in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Iraq  where sizable concentrations of Syrians are living in urban areas. The map also identifies official Iraqi IDP camps that are open and under construction. It shows numbers of externally displaced Syrians reported in the four neighboring countries, as well as in Egypt and North Africa. Charts illustrate numbers of Syrians who are registered or awaiting registration for humanitarian assistance in neighboring countries and living in camps or outside camps.
