# Careers

For job opportunities, consult the USA Jobs website [http://usajobs.gov/](http://usajobs.gov).

If you are interested in possible internships with the HIU or other offices within the State Department, you can find more information at the [Student Programs](http://careers.state.gov/intern) webpage.

Additionally, the [MapGive Team](http://mapgive.state.gov) at the Humanitarian Information Unit also accepts a few [Virtual Student Foreign Service](http://www.state.gov/vsfs/) interns each semester.  If interested, email MapGive at [mapgive@state.gov](mailto:mapgive@state.gov?subject=VSFS+Internship).

Lastly, the Humanitarian Information Unit has also housed a [Presidential Innovation Fellow](https://www.whitehouse.gov/innovationfellows).  However, we do not have a position open at this time.
