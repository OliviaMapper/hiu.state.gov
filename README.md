Prototype of New hiu.state.gov (hiu.state.gov)
================

## Description

Prototype of the U.S. Department of State Humanitarian Information Unit's new public-facing website, hiu.state.gov.

## Installation

Site is tested and built using Ubuntu. To install locally, jekyll is required.

## Usage


If updated less (`src/less`) or javascript (`src/js/`), run gulp to update:

```
gulp
```

If you updated bootstrap variables (`src/less/bootstrap/variables.less`), re-compile the bootstrap.css with:

```
gulp bootstrap:compile
```

## Examples

TBD


### Search


#### The events page is depreciated at this time

### CSS

multiple libraries are used, however Sass/SCSS is mainly used along with bootstrap. Jekyll provides [built-in support for Sass](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/). The Bootstrap partials are in the _sass directory. The main Sass/SCSS file is named main.scss and is in the css directory. Jekyll automatically processes it and puts it in the site's destination folder.
