For the Ebola crisis, the Humanitarain Information, in a partnership, stood up the [Ebola GeoNode](http://ebolageonode.org).

This is a partnership platform for sharing geospatial data, analysis and maps related to the Ebola emergency response. The platform is intended to minimize the time that GIS analysts spend locating up-to-date data. Users are able to make maps on the fly, view metadata, and access the reports behind GIS layers. Curators are working to ensure that the layers are recent, clean, useful, and legally and technically open.
