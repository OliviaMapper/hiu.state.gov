For the Ebola crisis, the Humanitarian Information Unit, in partnership with the World Bankâ€™s [Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery](https://www.gfdrr.org/) (GFDRR) and the [United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency Response](http://ebolaresponse.un.org/un-mission-ebola-emergency-response-unmeer) (UNMEER), launched [Ebola GeoNode](http://ebolageonode.org).

[Ebola GeoNode](http://ebolageonode.org) is a partnership platform for sharing geospatial data, analysis and maps related to the Ebola emergency response. The platform is intended to minimize the time that GIS analysts spend locating up-to-date data. Users are able to make maps on the fly, view metadata, and access the reports behind GIS layers. Curators are working to ensure that the layers are recent, clean, useful, and legally and technically open.

The data on Ebola GeoNode is being transitioned to the United Nation's [Humanitarian Data Exchange](http://data.hdx.rwlabs.org/) (HDX) for long-run management.
