Lee Schwartz, Kurt, and Andrew presented to a group of students from the Washington metropolitan area. Students learned about the U.S. Department of State's Office of the Geographer and the Humanitarian Information Unit. Kurt showed several examples of HIU infographics and our production process. Following the presentations participants mapped [refugee settlements in northern Uganda](https://tasks.hotosm.org/project/4141) using OpenStreetMap. Our MapGive initiative has been supporting mapping projects in this region with satellite imagery services.
